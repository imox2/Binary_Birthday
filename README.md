We all sometimes feel a little geeky.

The code tries to encode the birthday message which you want to send to your friend (or any other message) into binary.
Then you can copy the binary message and post on his birthday page ( you can email it too, by copying and pasting).
If you feel binary is not the way to go, you can convert it into ascii too. 

How to convert it to ascii or binary?
You will know it when you run the script.
